                     <h3>Offer</h3>
<ol start="4">

</li>

<li>Limit of one rebate claim per valid full-version product purchased, up to a maximum of one (1) rebate claim per person, and three (3) per household or registered business address. Claimants must retain their original purchase receipt(s) and product packaging for all claims as proof of purchase.
